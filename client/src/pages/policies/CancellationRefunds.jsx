            <h3>MELETH VINOJ VIVEK believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:
            </h3>
            <p> Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within same day of placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.
            </p>
            <p> MELETH VINOJ VIVEK does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of product delivered is not good.
            </p>
            <p>
In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the same to our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at his own end. This should be reported within same day of receipt of the products.
